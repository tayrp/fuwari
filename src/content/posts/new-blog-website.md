I now have a new blog website. It is based on the Fuwari template. You can find the link at the bottom of this post.
I've also migrated all my previous posts to this new site, view them on the Archive page. :)

## What kind of posts?
I will be posting content related to myself and the things I work on, including games, projects, servers, and similar topics.
