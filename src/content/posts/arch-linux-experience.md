# Hey There 💜

Incase you're unfamiliar, my name is Valerie, and this is my blog.

## Feels too smooth
I've started using Arch Linux with KDE Plasma on my Desktop system, and messed around with other session managers like hyprland, and weston, I like how customizable hyprland is, though I feel it's a bit of an oddity when it comes to just using something like KDE.

## Gaming
I tried playing Fallout 4 on highest settings, and it wasn't all that great, I assume due to swap allocation or similar, but it was really laggy unlike my Windows installation playing the same game.

### More simple blogs coming soon (hopefully)
